# PITS - Personal Information Tracker/Spider

## Note

This is an extremely old project, actually as I'm updating this it's 12.5 years old.  As such a lot has changed with the
way that websites are structured and everything else.  That's actually the only reason I'm opening this up to be a public
repository now as it's mostly for posterity sake now as it's functionally useless (I mean who even uses MySpace anymore?)

But anyways, enjoy some of the stuff I did when I was younger I guess.

## ReadMe

information on a number of individuals and then search myspace,
facebook, and other common social networking sites to gather more
